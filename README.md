# ObstacleAvoidingRobot
An Arduino-based Obstacle Avoiding Robot

Versions

Bluetooth Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/RobotContro/

Obstacle Avoiding Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/ObstacleAvoidingRobot/

IR Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/IRRobot/

Line Tracking Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/LTMRobot/

Based on:
===
*  Arduino U*  Arduino UNO R3
*  L298N motor driver
*  HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Module

When assembled, this becomes a self-controlling and obstacle avoiding robot.

I based it off of https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M2Z9ZTV/ with my own custom shield. Everything but the Ultrasonic Sensor whose Echo and Trigger are A0 and A1, respectively, is the same.
